Package that runs a battery of univariate normality tests on the row or column vectors of a pandas.DataFrame (df). The packages comes with a `DataFrameGenerator` that can produce dfs following a `uniform`, `normal` or `mixed` distribution. These dataframes or any other dfs can be run through the `NormalityBattery` class which runs the conventional normality tests by [Kolmogorov A (1933)](https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10010480527/), [Smirnov N (1948)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2236278?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), [Shapiro and Wilk (1965)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2333709?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), [Jarque and Bera (1980)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165176580900245), [D’Agostino (1971)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2334522) and [Pearson’s (1973)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335012?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). The results of the test are summaried in a report which can be accessed via the `print_report` method in the `NormalityBattery` class.
